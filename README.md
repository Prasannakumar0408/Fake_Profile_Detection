**FAKE PROFILE DETECTION IN SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS**

**INTRODUCTION**

Social media platforms have tens of millions of fake users, which puts users' security and privacy at risk. The Identification of fake users in these networks is crucial for improving user experience and safety. The interest in the verification of a legitimate profile is becoming more and more popular.

**OBJECTIVE**

The goal of this project is to create a model to recognize fake profiles on social media platforms based on the account type, followers, number of people following, date of registration, and other factors.

**DATA IDENTIFICATION**

This dataset taken from Kaggle contains information on 786 real users and false users of the Instagram social media network, together with 12 other parameters as follows, Profile Pic, Nums/Length Username, Fullname Words, Nums/Length Fullname, Name/Username, Description Length, External URL, Private, Posts, Followers, Follows, Fake.

**CLASSIFICATION MODELS**

We have used the following Machine-learning predictive models
1. Gaussian Naïve Bayes
2. KNN with Manhattan distance

As demonstrated above, this prediction model is validated using two different classifiers. It can be seen clearly that KNN performs better than Gaussian model.
